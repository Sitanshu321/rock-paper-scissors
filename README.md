This project is a simple Python implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. The user plays against the computer, which randomly selects rock ('r'), paper ('p'), or scissors ('s'). The user inputs their choice, and the program determines the winner based on the game rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. If both the user and the computer choose the same item, the game results in a tie. The project demonstrates basic Python concepts like user input, conditional statements, and random selection.
